## Project 1: HR Data Analytics - Employee Attrition Dashboard  

**Objective:**  
Analyze employee attrition factors and provide actionable insights to reduce turnover.

**Dataset:**  
`HR_Analytics.csv`  
Contains employee data with columns such as EmpID, Age, Attrition, Department, MonthlyIncome, etc.

**Key Steps:**  

- **Data Cleaning:** Removed empty columns and handled missing values.  
- **Data Transformation using Power Query:**  
  - Added a new column for attrition count and created DAX measures for attrition rate:  
    ```DAX
    AttritionCount = IF([Attrition] = "Yes", 1, 0)  
    Attrition Rate = (SUM([AttritionCount])) / (SUM([EmployeeCount]))
    ```
- **Dashboard:**  
  - Visualized attrition trends, employee demographics, and key performance indicators.  
  - Included slicers for filtering by department and gender.  

**Report File:**  
Report file [HR_Analytics(.pbix)](https://github.com/Ak-AlphaData/Power-BI-Projects/tree/main/HR-Analytics)

## Projects Overview  
Each folder contains a Power BI (.pbix) report, the data sources, and any documentation related to the project. Below are the highlights of what each project covers:  

### Data Importing & Loading  
- Extracted data from multiple sources such as CSV, Excel, and SQL databases.  
- Leveraged Power Query for data transformation.  

### Data Cleaning & Transformation  
- Cleaned datasets (handled missing values, duplicates, and data inconsistencies).  
- Performed data type corrections and column transformations.  
- Merged and appended datasets as needed for analysis.  

### Reporting & Dashboarding  
- Built dynamic dashboards and reports with interactive visuals.  
- Used DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) to create calculated measures and columns.  
- Implemented slicers, filters, and drill-throughs for better insights.  

### Performance Optimization  
- Applied best practices for report optimization (e.g., reducing model size and improving load times).
